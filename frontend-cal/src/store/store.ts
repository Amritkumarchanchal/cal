/**
 * Redux Store Configuration
 *
 * This file configures the main Redux store using Redux Toolkit's configureStore.
 * It combines multiple reducers and middleware to create a centralized state management store.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Combines multiple domain-specific reducers (auth, institute, user, etc.)
 * - Integrates RTK Query API services with their reducers and middleware
 * - Uses Redux Toolkit's default middleware configuration
 * - Provides type-safe state management
 *
 * The store includes the following slices:
 * - auth: Handles authentication state
 * - institute: Manages institute-related data
 * - user: Stores user information
 * - videoDetails: Manages video-related state
 * - course: Handles course data
 * - module: Manages module information
