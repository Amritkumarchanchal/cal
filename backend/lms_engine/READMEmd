# LMS Engine

## Running the Development Environment

To set up and run the development environment for the LMS Engine, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Project in a Container:**
    Ensure you have Docker and VS Code with the Remote - Containers extension installed. Open the project in a container using VS Code.

2. **Install Development Requirements:**
    Once the container is up and running, install the development dependencies by running:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. **Starting the Server:**
    If the server does not start automatically, you can manually start it by running:
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

4. **Troubleshooting:**
    If you encounter any issues, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the container is properly configured.
