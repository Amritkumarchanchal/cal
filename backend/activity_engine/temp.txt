After an assessment is accessed an entry into the table(StudentAssessmentAccessHistory) 
with the following fields 
asseessment id
access_time, 
course_instance_id, 
student_id

is made.
the frontend recieves back the access_id,

-> if the student submits, the is_submitted is made true, and the submission_time is updated,
and the student is immediately graded.
